# 🚀 Dockerized Data Engineering Starter Kit

This repository is a **starter template** for data engineers who work with **dbt**, **SQLMesh**, **Apache Airflow**, and **Snowflake**, but are new to **Docker**.  
It provides a simple, Dockerized environment to help you get up and running quickly—no Docker expertise required!

---

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- Data Engineers familiar with **dbt**, **SQLMesh**, **Airflow**, **Snowflake**.
- Anyone struggling to set up Docker for data engineering workflows.
- Those who want a **clean starting point** for containerized data pipelines.

---

## ⚙️ What’s Inside

- ✅ Dockerfile (Airflow 2.10.5 + dbt + SQLMesh + Snowflake connectors)
- ✅ docker-compose.yaml (Orchestrates your services)
- ✅ Python script to create recommended folder structure
- ✅ Easy-to-understand folder mappings for Docker volumes

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you start, you’ll need:
- Docker (v20+ recommended)
- Docker Compose (v1.29+ or built into Docker CLI)
- Python 3.x (for optional folder setup script)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docker-data-engineering-starter.git
cd docker-data-engineering-starter
```

### 2. (Optional) Run the Folder Structure Script
```bash
python create_folder_structure.py
```

This creates folders like:
```
dags/       # Airflow DAGs
plugins/    # Airflow plugins
logs/       # Logs from services
dbt/        # Your dbt project
sqlmesh/    # Your SQLMesh project
config/     # Config files
```

### 3. Build and Start Services
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 4. Access the Airflow Webserver
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

Default credentials:
```
Username: airflow
Password: airflow
```

├── setup_folders.py        # Script to create folder structure
└── README.md               # Documentation (this file)
```

---

## 🔧 Customization

- Add your dbt projects inside the `/dbt` folder.
- Add Airflow DAGs to `/dags`.
- Modify `docker-compose.yaml` to add services like Postgres.
- Edit the Dockerfile to install additional Python packages or dependencies.
